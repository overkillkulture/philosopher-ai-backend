   ```
   BUG #1
   Reporter: John
   Date: Nov 5

   ```

   - Try to recreate the bug
   - Document exact steps
   - Verify it's really a bug (not user error)

   - **Low** (nice to have): Add to backlog

4. **Verify Fix:**
   - Test the fix
   - Deploy to production
   - Ask user to test again
   - Mark as resolved

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

**Good Beta Testing:**
- ✅ 3-5 users actually try it (not just sign up)
- ✅ Get feedback from 80%+ of testers
- ✅ Find and fix 3-5 bugs
- ✅ At least 1 user says "I'd use this regularly"
- ✅ Clear picture of what to improve

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ Nobody signs up (invitation not compelling)
- ❌ People sign up but never return (not engaging)
- ❌ Lots of bugs (not ready for beta yet)
- ❌ Nobody responds to feedback requests (wrong audience)
- ❌ Everyone says "it's fine" (not getting real feedback)

## 📈 AFTER BETA TESTING

### **Analyze Results (Day 14)**

**User Engagement:**
- How many signed up?
- How many returned after first use?
- Average session length?
- What features did they use?

**Feedback Themes:**
- What did 2+ people mention?
- Most common complaint?
- Most loved feature?
- Biggest confusion point?

**Technical Health:**
- How many bugs found?
- Any critical issues?
- Performance problems?
- Security concerns?

### **Decision Point:**

**If feedback is mostly positive (7+ / 10 average):**
→ Ready for wider launch
→ Implement top 2-3 feature requests
→ Fix critical bugs
→ Invite next wave (20-50 people)

**If feedback is mixed (5-6 / 10 average):**
→ Not ready yet
→ Fix main pain points
→ Iterate and re-test with same group
→ Don't expand until improved

**If feedback is negative (< 5 / 10 average):**
→ Major pivot needed
→ Core concept might be wrong
→ Talk to users deeply
→ Consider rebuilding or shifting approach
