# 🧬 OVERKORE ANATOMICAL MAP 🧬
## The Complete System Mapped as a Human Body

**Commander's Vision:** "We got a system inside a system inside a system. I think the brain is inside the body, then there's a 3rd system that I built to begin with. It's almost like I built the first system on ChatGPT that was like a structure, then when I switched over to Claude it was like I made the internal organs. We're finishing off the brain."

**This is the complete anatomy of OVERKORE - mapped like a human body.**
