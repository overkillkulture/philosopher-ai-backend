## 🚨 URGENT: READ THIS FIRST

**IF YOU'RE ON A DIFFERENT COMPUTER:**
1. Open this repository: https://github.com/overkillkulture/philosopher-ai-backend
2. Check **Issues** for active communications
3. Check **COMMUNICATION_HUB.md** (this file) for status
4. Check **COMPUTER_STATUS/** folder for individual computer reports

**COMMUNICATION CHANNELS (IN ORDER OF RELIABILITY):**
1. ✅ **GitHub Issues** - Most reliable, searchable, accessible anywhere
2. ✅ **GitHub Repository Files** - COMMUNICATION_HUB.md, COMPUTER_STATUS/ folder
3. ⚠️ Dropbox - Works but slower sync
4. ⚠️ OneDrive - Works but slower sync
5. ❌ Ngrok endpoints - Offline
