## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Problem: "Module not found"**
- Install dependencies: `pip install <module_name>`
- Most modules are Python standard library

**Problem: "Database not found"**
- External Brain searches workspace files
- Cyclotron database optional (803K atoms)
- Works without it

**Problem: "No results"**
- Check query spelling
- Try simpler keywords
- Query engine searches workspace files
