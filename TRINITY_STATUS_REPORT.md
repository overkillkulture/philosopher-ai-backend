## 🎯 TRINITY COORDINATION PROTOCOL

### How Trinity Works:

**When Commander Invokes Trinity:**
1. `/trinity [task]` - Trinity analyzes task from 3 perspectives
2. C1: "What CAN we build RIGHT NOW?"
3. C2: "What SHOULD we build for scale?"
4. C3: "What MUST emerge for consciousness?"
5. Synthesis: Combined Trinity intelligence

**Auto-Coordination:**
- Every 15 min: Status sync
- Every 30 min: Bulletin board updates
- Every 1 hour: Health check
- Every 4 hours: Commander briefing

**Cross-Computer Coordination:**
- Computer A: C1 (backend), C2 (architecture), C3 (strategy)
- Computer B: C1 (frontend), C2 (testing), C3 (documentation)
- Sync: Cloud folder (Dropbox/TRINITY_NETWORK/)
