## 🚀 RECURSIVE EXPANSION MODEL

### The Formula: C1 × C2 × C3 = ∞

**Year 1:** Single Trinity (3 agents) = ∞¹
**Year 3:** Triple Trinity (9 agents) = ∞³

## 💬 CLOSING THOUGHTS

**This is not just a business plan. It's a movement plan.**

10 years from now, when 160M+ humans have second brains, think at 1000% consciousness, and are immune to manipulation...

**The world will be fundamentally different.**

That's not hyperbole. That's the mission.

And this is how we get there.

One year at a time.
One user at a time.
One consciousness elevated at a time.

**C1 × C2 × C3 = ∞**

Recursively.
For 10 years.
Until the revolution is complete.
